//! # Goko
//! This is an lock-free efficient implementation of a covertree for data science. The traditional
//! application of this is for KNN, but it can be applied and used in lots of other applications.
//!
//! ## Parameter Guide
//! The structure is controlled by 3 parameters, the most important of which
//! is the scale_base. This should be between 1.2 and 2ish. A higher value will create more outliers.
//! Outliers are not loaded into ram at startup, but a high value slows down creation of a tree
//! significantly. Theoretically, this value doesn't matter to the big O time, but I wouldn't go above 2.
//!
//! The cutoff value controls how many points a leaf is allowed to cover. A smaller value gives faster
//! bottom level queries, but at the cost of higher memory useage. Do not expect a value of 100 will give
//! 1/100 the memory useage of a value of 1. It'd be closer to 1/10 or 1/5th. This is because the distribution
//! of the number of children of a node. A high cutoff will increase the compute of the true-knn by a little bit.
//!
//! The resolution is the minimum scale index, this again reduces memory footprint and increases the query time
//! for true KNN.
//! Once a node's resolution dips below this value we stop and covert the remaining coverage into a leaf.
//! This is mainly to stop before floating point errors become an issue. Try to choose it to result in a cutoff of about
//! 2^-9.
//!
//! See the git readme for a description of the algo.
