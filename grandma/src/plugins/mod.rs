//! # Plugin System
//!
//! To implement a plugin you need to write 2 components one which implements `NodePlugin` and another that implements `TreePlugin`.
//! Finally you need to create an object that implements the parent trait that glues the two objects together.
//!
//! The `NodePlugin` is attached to each node. It is created by the `node_component` function in the parent trait when the plugin is
//! attached to the tree. It can access the `TreePlugin` component, and the tree. These are created recursively, so you can access the
//! plugin for the child nodes.
//!
//! None of this is parallelized. We need to move to Tokio to take advantage of the async computation there to || it.
